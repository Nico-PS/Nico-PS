## 👋 About Me
I'm a Software Developer with extensive experience in cloud-based application development, specializing in AWS services. With a strong background in telecommunications, I also manage VoIP servers like Asterisk and 3CX, and have in-depth knowledge of networking, including setting up VPNs between on-premise datacenters and the cloud.

I am passionate about continuously expanding my skill set, and I'm currently exploring container technologies and generative AI.

## 🌐 Cloud Development
I have a solid foundation in deploying and managing applications on AWS. My expertise includes:

Infrastructure as Code: I create and manage cloud resources using AWS CDK and TypeScript, enabling automated and repeatable deployments.
EC2 Management: From configuring virtual machines to handling scaling and security, I ensure that cloud environments are optimized for performance.
Networking in the Cloud: I design and implement complex networking setups, including VPCs, subnets, and VPNs that connect cloud resources with on-premise infrastructure.

## 💻 Web Development
I'm skilled in frontend development using ReactJS. I build modern, responsive web applications that are both scalable and maintainable. My projects often integrate with various backend services, showcasing a full-stack approach.

## 📞 Telecommunications Expertise
As a Telecommunications Engineer, I have extensive experience in managing VoIP servers, particularly Asterisk and 3CX. My work includes:

Server Configuration: Setting up and maintaining VoIP servers to ensure reliable communication systems.
Network Integration: Implementing secure and efficient communication networks, both on-premise and in the cloud.

## 🛠️ Containers & AI Exploration
I am currently diving into container technologies, including Docker and Kubernetes, to enhance the scalability and portability of applications. Additionally, I am exploring generative AI technologies, aiming to integrate them into innovative projects.

## 📝 Blog & Continuous Learning
I believe in the power of continuous learning and regularly document my journey. My blog features insights and tutorials on the latest technologies I’m exploring, such as container orchestration and AI.

## 🔧 Automated Workflows
I implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate testing, deployment, and code analysis across my projects. This not only streamlines development but also ensures that my code is always up to the highest standards.
